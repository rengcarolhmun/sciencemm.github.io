## Project Description

ScienceMM is a web platform dedicated to sharing scientific knowledge within the Burmese-speaking community. Inspired by the question-and-answer format of platforms like Quora, ScienceMM aims to be a central place where anyone can ask science-related questions and receive clear, understandable answers, all in the Myanmar language.

Our goal is to foster curiosity, encourage learning, and make science accessible to everyone in Myanmar.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to:
* Provide a platform for Burmese speakers to easily access and share scientific information.
* Create a community-driven repository of science questions and answers in the Myanmar language.
* Bridge the gap in accessing science content published primarily in other languages.

## Target Audience

This website is specifically for:
* Students, educators, and enthusiasts in Myanmar interested in science.
* Anyone who prefers to learn and discuss science topics in the Myanmar language.

## Features (Current or Planned)

* **Browse Questions:** Explore science questions categorized by topics (e.g., Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Astronomy, Mathematics, etc.).
* **Read Answers:** Find detailed and easy-to-understand answers to various science questions.
* **Search:** Easily search for questions and answers using keywords in Burmese.
* **Community Contributions:** (Structured via GitHub) Allowing users to suggest new questions, provide answers, or improve existing content through contributions.
* **Content in Myanmar Language:** All questions, answers, and navigation elements are in Burmese.

## Structure

The website is structured around a Question & Answer format. Each topic or question might have its own page or section, designed for readability and ease of navigation.
