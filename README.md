# ScienceMM: သိပ္ပံမေးဖြေ (Science Q&A for Myanmar)

## Project Description

ScienceMM is a web platform dedicated to sharing scientific knowledge within the Burmese-speaking community. Inspired by the question-and-answer format of platforms like Quora, ScienceMM aims to be a central place where anyone can ask science-related questions and receive clear, understandable answers, all in the Myanmar language.

Our goal is to foster curiosity, encourage learning, and make science accessible to everyone in Myanmar.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to:
* Provide a platform for Burmese speakers to easily access and share scientific information.
* Create a community-driven repository of science questions and answers in the Myanmar language.
* Bridge the gap in accessing science content published primarily in other languages.

## Target Audience

This website is specifically for:
* Students, educators, and enthusiasts in Myanmar interested in science.
* Anyone who prefers to learn and discuss science topics in the Myanmar language.

## Features

* **Browse Questions:** Explore science questions categorized by topics (e.g., Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Astronomy, Mathematics, etc.).
* **Read Answers:** Find detailed and easy-to-understand answers to various science questions.
* **Search:** Easily search for questions and answers using keywords in Burmese.
* **Community Contributions:** The platform is built to easily incorporate contributions of new questions, answers, and content improvements from the community via GitHub.
* **Content in Myanmar Language:** All questions, answers, and key navigation elements are in Burmese.

## Structure

The website is structured around a Question & Answer format. Content is organized for readability and ease of navigation, making it simple to find information on specific science topics.

## Getting Started (For Visitors)

Simply visit the website at [https://sciencemm.github.io/](https://sciencemm.github.io/) to start Browse questions and answers. Use the search functionality to find specific topics you're interested in.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone willing to share their scientific knowledge or help improve the platform! As this project is hosted on GitHub Pages, contributions are managed through this repository.
